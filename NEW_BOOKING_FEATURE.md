# New Booking Notification System

## Overview
This feature shows guides a modal popup whenever they have new booking requests, either when they're already logged in or when they log in for the first time.

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Detection**
- Every time the guide dashboard fetches data, it checks for new pending bookings
- Uses AsyncStorage to track which bookings have already been shown to avoid duplicates
- Shows modal immediately if new bookings are found

### 2. **Smart Notification Logic**
- Only shows truly new bookings (not previously notified)
- Handles multiple new bookings by showing them one at a time
- Persists notification history across app sessions

### 3. **User-Friendly Modal Interface**
- Beautiful, prominent modal that can't be missed
- Shows essential booking details at a glance
- Multiple action options for flexible handling

## Features

### **New Booking Modal Display**
- **Customer Information**: Name, email, guest count
- **Booking Details**: Date(s), total amount
- **Customer Message**: Special requests or notes (if provided)
- **Multi-booking Support**: Counter showing "1 of 3 new requests" when multiple bookings exist

### **Action Options**
1. **âœ“ Accept** - Immediately confirm the booking
2. **âœ— Reject** - Decline the booking request  
3. **View Full Details** - Open the detailed customer modal
4. **Skip & Next / Decide Later** - Mark as seen, handle later
5. **Close (X)** - Dismiss all remaining notifications

### **Smart Handling**
- **Automatic Progression**: After accepting/rejecting, automatically shows next new booking
- **Persistent Tracking**: Remembers which bookings were shown even after app restart
- **Fallback Safety**: If anything fails, the normal booking list still works

## Files Modified

### **New Files Created:**
- `utils/newBookingService.js` - Service for managing new booking notifications

### **Enhanced Files:**
- `app/(guide)/dashboard.jsx` - Added modal UI and integration logic

## How to Test

### **Test Button (Orange ðŸ””)**
- Added an orange notification button in the dashboard header
- Click it to simulate a new booking request
- This helps test the modal functionality

### **Real Usage Flow**
1. A customer creates a booking for the guide
2. Guide opens/refreshes the dashboard
3. Modal automatically appears with new booking details
4. Guide can accept, reject, or view more details
5. If multiple bookings exist, they're shown one by one

## Technical Implementation

### **Storage Strategy**
```javascript
// Tracks notified bookings per guide
Key: "new_bookings_notified_{userId}"
Value: ["booking1_id", "booking2_id", ...]
```

### **Modal State Management**
- `newBookingModalVisible` - Controls modal visibility
- `newBookings` - Array of new bookings to show
- `currentNewBookingIndex` - Which booking is currently being displayed

### **Integration Points**
- Hooks into existing `fetchData()` function
- Uses existing `handleBookingStatusUpdate()` for accept/reject
- Seamlessly integrates with current customer details modal

## Benefits

- Immediate awareness of new opportunities
- Quick decision-making interface

### **For Business**

## Future Enhancements

### **Possible Additions**

## Usage Notes

### **Production Mode**

- System works automatically with real bookings
